WARNING: I have abandoned this; the code is uglier than I liked since I planned on cleaning it up in the future, some refactors were needed

I discovered making a game engine from scratch is too time consuming, but I learned a lot with it

How to run (WARNING: loud sounds):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:IVSOP/MarchingCubes.git
cd MarchingCubes
./build.sh && ./build/MarchingCubes
```

NOTE: all assets I used are either free to use and distribute or created by me but I may have forgotten attribution, will add in the future
