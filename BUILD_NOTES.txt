mingw needs plugin to use IPO, cant use it for now
libsoundio was a nightmare to automate its build due to how it was setup, had to build manually. this really turned me off about it, switched to openAL soft
turns out openal soft is the EXACT same, creating a config when built
gave up and built it semi-manually
